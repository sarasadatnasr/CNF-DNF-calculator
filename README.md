# CNF-DNF-calculator
This desktop app will help you calculate conjunctive normal form (CNF) and disjunctive normal form (DNF) faster. It also has a simple graphic user interface for easy use. Hope you enjoy it:)  Ps: Implement for the foundation of logic and set theory course, fall 2022

# INTRODUCTION
This desktop app will support and: /\, or: \/, not: ~, implication: ->, and symbols like paranteses and variables like x1,x2,.. you are free to input all formulas you want.

# HOW DOES IT WORK?
According to the button you choose (CNF or DNF), "to_symbol_form" compiles your formula to a parsed expression by "Parse_Tree" and the output is sent to "Negation" to return only a tree with unary "not", and at the end, "Symbol_Tree" returns the tree with distribution laws included. This law contains: Idempotency and Absorption laws, Applying Distribution laws, Applying De Morgan's laws and involution,

Finally you have the CNF/DNF form. More data is in the code.
